# Install winget from PowerShell

- Install [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) straight from PowerShell
- Always gets the latest version of Windows Terminal
- Works on Windows 10, Windows 11, Server 2022
- WinGet (and therefore this script) requires "Windows 10 version 1809 or newer (LTSC included)"
- Does not work on Server 2019

## Script Functionality

-   The latest version of [Microsoft.UI.Xaml](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml/) is downloaded and installed. Note that for some reason, the NuGet API doesn't always work. If this happens, the script will use the hardcoded version.

-   [VCLibs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/troubleshoot/developer/visualstudio/cpp/libraries/c-runtime-packages-desktop-bridge#how-to-install-and-update-desktop-framework-packages) and [Xaml](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml/) are installed first

-   Processor architecture is determined for prerequisites

-   [VCLibs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/troubleshoot/developer/visualstudio/cpp/libraries/c-runtime-packages-desktop-bridge#how-to-install-and-update-desktop-framework-packages) is installed straight from the appx package

-   [Xaml](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.UI.Xaml/) is installed by downloading the **nupkg**, extracting it, and installing the **appx** package

-   [winget-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) is then installed

-   User **PATH** variable is adjusted to include WindowsApps folder

-   Grabs the latest version of winget on each run

## Setup

### Method 1 - PowerShell Gallery

- In PowerShell, type
```powershell
Install-Script winget-install -Force
```
- answer **Yes** to all prompts if asked
**Note:** `-Force` is optional, but it will force the script to update if it is outdated.

The script is published on [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/winget-install) under `winget-install`.

### Tip - How to trust PSGallery

If you want to trust PSGallery so you aren't prompted each time you run this command, you can type...

```powershell
Set-PSRepository -Name 'PSGallery' -InstallationPolicy Trusted
```

### Method 2 - Download Locally and Run

- Download `winget-install.ps1`
- Run the script with `.\winget-install.ps1`

## Usage

In PowerShell, type

```powershell
winget-install
```

## Available Scripts

- **winget-install.ps1**
	- Unsigned script in the repo, signed script in releases

## Troubleshooting

- If you receive an error message about the Appx module not being loaded, try using a different version of PowerShell (version 6 and 7 seem to be buggy still, but the native PowerShell version in Windows works)
- Open an issue if you run into a persistant problem.
